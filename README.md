### A graphical editor and simulation tool in support of the Functional Resonance Analysis Method

Inspired by my first discussion with Adrie Adriaensen, I recyled and adapted a significant part
of my Linny-R software to a diagramming tool for FRAM -- hence the name diaFRAM.

I intend to develop it further so that it will perform a dynamic simulation that is
consistent with the basic idea of FRAM.

The leading principle for development is "functionality without fuss". I try to
minimize the number of elements of the graphical user interface, while maximizing
its intuitive logic.

Feedback is welcome.
