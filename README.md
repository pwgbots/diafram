### A graphical editor and simulation tool in support of the Functional Resonance Analysis Method

Inspired by my first discussion with Adrie Adriaensen, I recyled and adapted a significant part
of my Linny-R software to rapidly prototype a diagramming tool for FRAM -- hence the name diaFRAM.

I intend to develop it further so that it will perform a dynamic simulation that is
consistent with the basic idea of FRAM.

My leading principle for software development is "functionality without fuss". I try to
minimize the number of elements of the graphical user interface, while maximizing
its intuitive logic.

The diaFRAM software is 100% HTML + CSS + Javascript. It should run in any modern browser.
Installation is simple: copy files and folders to a directory on your computer while preserving
the directory structure. The opening `index.html` in your browser should do the trick.

Feedback is welcome.
